## <i class='fas fa-paint-brush'></i> Designing experiments


- Designing a comparative experiment in the biological sciences is to identify a data-collection scheme that:
  - achieve sensitivity and specificity requirements 
  - despite biological and technical variability, 
  - while keeping time and resource costs low.

## Comparative experiments

**Aim**: test if a new supplement increases milk yield from Holstein Friesian cows.

<center>

`r paste(rep(cows1[1], 1), collapse = "")`

`r paste(supps[1], collapse="")`

`r milk(5)`
</center>

::: incremental

- Is the new supplement effective?
- Most experiments are comparative in nature.
- Historical data suggests that Holstein Friesian cows have an average milk yield of `r milk(4)`
- Is the new supplement better?
- Are historical data comparable to new experimental data?

:::

## Controls

::: incremental

- **Historical controls** are results of similar experiments from historical or past records. 
- Problem with comparing the treatment group and historical control group is that the _groups may differ in important ways besides the treatment_.
- The **control group** should be in the same experiment as treatment group where ideally the difference between the two groups is only the treatment.
- A _control_ does not mean necessarily "do nothing" treatment, but can be the current standard practice or a **placebo**.
- A **placebo** is a treatment designed to have no therapeutic value, but to ensure that the subjects are blind to whether they have taken the new treatment.
- In some experiments, it is important to to ensure the researchers and/or technicians are also blind to the treatment.

:::


## Unreplicated experiments

**Aim**: test if a new supplement increases milk yield from Holstein Friesian cows compared to the control treatment.

<center>

`r paste(rep(cows1[1], 3), collapse = "")`

`r paste(supps, collapse="")`

`r milk(5)` `r milk(4)` `r milk(1)`

</center>

<br>

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

Statistical anatomy of the experiment:

* **Units**:
  * **Experimental units**: 2 cows
  * **Observational units**: 2 cows
* **Response**: milk yield
* **Treatments**: 3 types of supplements
* **Allotment**: supplements <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> cows

:::

::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}

* **Conclusion**: <img src='/images/supplement1.png' style='height:1em'> produces most <img src='/images/milk.png' style='height:1em'> therefore <img src='/images/supplement1.png' style='height:1em'> is the most effective supplement for higher milk yield from cows out of the three supplements tested

* How confident will you be of this conclusion?


:::

:::


## Natural variation of units

**Aim**: To compare the effectiveness of three supplements on milk yield from cows.

<center>
`r paste(c(cows2[1], cows1[c(1, 4)]), collapse = "")`

`r paste(supps, collapse="")`

`r milk(5)` `r milk(4)` `r milk(1)`


<br>

</center>

- Ensure uniform material are used for experimental units as much as you can, but
- <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> no individual experimental units are the same (with some exceptions).
- There will be a natural variation of the experimental units. 

## Treatment replications

**Aim**: To compare the effectiveness of three supplements on milk yield from cows.

<center>

`r paste(cows1, collapse = "")`

`r paste(rep(supps, each = 2), collapse="")`

`r milk(4)` `r milk(6)` `r milk(5)` `r milk(3)` `r milk(1)` `r milk(1)`

</center>

<br>

- Treatment replications increases precision and quantify uncertainty.
- Ideally we want higher replications but resources limit this.



## Confounded factors

**Aim**: To compare the effectiveness of three supplements on milk yield from cows.

:::
 
 </center>

:::

:::

<br>

::: incremental

- **Units**: 2 pens with 3 cows each
-  Are the treatment means comparable?
- In this case, the pen is **completely confounded** (or aliased) with the supplement.
- <i class="fas fa-skull-crossbones"></i> We do not get any valid inference about the treatment effects! 
- How would you distribute the treatments?

## Complete block designs 

**Aim**: To compare the effectiveness of three supplements on milk yield from cows.

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

<center>

::: {.border-box .w-50}

`r paste(cows1[1:3], collapse = "")`  
`r paste(supps, collapse = "")`  
`r milk(4)` `r milk(5)`  `r milk(1)`

 <br>

:::

</center>

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

<center>

::: {.border-box .w-50}

`r paste(cows1[4:6], collapse = "")`  
`r paste(supps, collapse = "")`  
 `r milk(10)` `r milk(8)` `r milk(5)`

:::
 
 </center>

:::

:::

<br>

::: incremental

* Every treatment appears once in each pen (referred to as *complete block designs*)
* Each treatment appears in every pen so you can be more confident that the treatment means are not due to the conditions of particular pens
- Comparing _like-with-like_ increases precision.
- Cows in the same pen share a more similar environment than cows in another pen.
- Different treatments to alike experimental units gives more precision in treatment comparison.

## Pseudo-replication 

**Aim**: To compare the effectiveness of three supplements on milk yield from cows.

::: columns

::: {.column width="33%"}

<center>

::: {.border-box .w-50}

`r paste(cows1[1:2], collapse = "")`  
`r paste(supps[1], collapse = "")`

::: {.border-box .w-50}

`r paste(cows1[5:6], collapse = "")`  
`r paste(supps[3], collapse = "")`  
 `r milk(3)` `r milk(4)` 

:::
 
 </center>

:::

:::

<br>

::: incremental

* **Allotment**: supplements <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> pens
* **Experimental units**: pens (not cows!), **Observational units**: cows
* There is only one replication of each treatment (not two!)

* We refer analysis that treat _repetition_ as replication as **pseudo-replication**.

:::


## Replication, Repetition, and Duplication



## Systematic designs 

<center>

`r paste(c(cows1), collapse = "")`

`r paste(rep(supps, each = 2), collapse="")`

</center>

::: incremental

- The supplement treatment is given in a systematic order. 
- What could go wrong with this?
- The order of the experimental units may be **_confounded_** with some extraneous factor
- Like say, the order of the experimental units was determined by the speed (fast to slow) of the cow to get to the feed
- This means that the more active cows are given <img src='/images/supplement1.png' style='height:1em'> and leasat active ones are given <img src='/images/supplement2.png' style='height:1em'> 

:::

## Randomisation 

<center>

`r paste(c(cows1), collapse = "")`

`r set.seed(2);paste(sample(rep(supps, each = 2)), collapse="")`

</center>

::: incremental

- Randomisation protects you against bias and potential unwanted confounding with extraneous factors
- Bias comes in many forms: obvious to not-so obvious,  known to unknown, and so on.

- Randomisation doesn't mean it'll completely shield you from all biases.
- Randomisation is like buying an insurance (but free!). 
- You can get a systematic order by chance! <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> This doesn't mean you should keep on randomising your design until get the layout you want! You should instead consider blocking your units before randomisation.

:::




## How to randomise?

- Preferably use a computer to randomise treatments to units. 



## Blocking

- Block what you can, randomise what you cannot.

anova(lm(Weight ~ Treatment + Glasshouse, data = df10v4)) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

**Estimated regression parameters**

```{r}
#| eval: false
summary(lm(Weight ~ Treatment + Glasshouse, data = df10v4)) |> 
  broom::tidy() |> 
  mutate(Term = c("Intercept", "Treatment", "Glasshouse")) |> 
  select(Term, Estimate = estimate, `Std Error` = std.error, `P value` = p.value) |>

## Summary


- Remember the basic design principles: controls, replication, blocking, and randomisaton. 
- Randomisation is like buying an insurance (but free!).
- Randomisation helps to protect you from unknown confounding factors. 
- Block what you can, randomise what you cannot.
- Watch out for pseudoreplication!
- Randomise using a computer program if possible.
